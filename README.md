### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jakub
#### Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. 
My name is Jakub, and I'm currently a second-year student majoring in Data Engineering at the University of Technology GdaÅ„sk. Although I don't have any commercial experience yet, I have been actively working on various projects throughout my university journey. This README will give you a brief overview of my interests, skills, and some of the projects I have worked on.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the theoretical aspects of deep learning from the book Understanding Deep Learning by Simon J.D. Prince (https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/).The practical part of the book focuses on learning in Python using libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib
- I'm familiarizing myself with the basics of PyTorch through courses on Udemy and Artificial Intelligence classes offered at the GdaÅ„sk University of Technology.
